As I write this blog post, there are 26 million unemployed Americans.  I am one of them.  I have spent the better part of the past decade working as an optician.  I enjoy the variety of tasks that come with the job.  I take the glasses prescription from the optometrist, help the customer select frames that are fashionable and functional, and perform maintenance on their glasses until they buy their next pair.  In short, I help people see and smile.  In many ways, it is fulfilling work.

However, a feeling has emerged over the last couple years that I can no longer ignore: a desire to be challenged.  This prompted me to research careers in other industries.  As I refined my search, one particular path rose to the top of the list.  Austin, TX, is hub for many things, such as live music and barbeque, but it is also a tech hotspot.  After speaking with several friends in the programming world, I was able to confirm that software engineering would provide the challege and opportunites I was pursuing.

I have a plethora of external motivators that will encourage me to successfully complete this program.  First, I am seeking employment.  I want to provide for my family.  I want to set an example for my daughters that hard work will be rewarded and that it's never too late to learn a new skill.  Ultimately, the motivation from within will drive me to excel.  I will emerge from this program with the training to meet the challenges of a new career.
